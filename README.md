# Progressive Modality Cooperation (TIP2021)

Code for Progressive Modality Cooperation (TIP2021). 

This work propose a multi-modality domain adaptation framework called Progressive Modality Cooperation (PMC) 
to transfer the knowledge learned from the source domain to the target domain by exploiting multiple modality clues (e.g., RGB and depth).
